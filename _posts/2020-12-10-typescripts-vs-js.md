Javascript is a scripting language. It has been there since 1995. It was created by Netscape Communications Corporation programmer called Brendan Eich. Intention was to use Javascript for small projects.  

Typescript is a modern age Javascript development language. Microsoft created that in 2012. Actually typescript is a 
superset of Javascript. What does that mean is Typescript has all the Javascript features and much more.

## Key Difference

- Typescript code needs to be compile while Javascript code doesn't need to compile
- Typescript supports the feature of prototyping. Javascript doesn't support this feature.
- Typescript uses concepts like Types, Interfaces to describe the data being used. Javascript doesn't have that concept.
- Typescript is ideal for larger projects whereas Javascript is ideal for smaller projects. 

Now let's compare the feature of each one. 

## Features of Javascript
 - Dynamic language. It's fleixble and powerful.
 - Strong testing workflow
 - Smaller learning curve. 
 - It's use for both client side and server

## Features of Typescript
  - Easy to maintain
  - Improve developers productivity. 
  - Optional static type annotation / Static typing
  - Additional features for functions
  - Support ES6
  - Supports interfaces, sub-interfaces, classes & sub-classes

## Which one is better ?
  It depends on the situation. If an experienced developer working on a smaller project Javascript is ideal. But if you have knowledge and expertise development team, then Typescript is more suitable.
